# VClean: Empowering Data Cleaning

[VClean]([url](https://vclean.streamlit.app/)) is a Python application built to automate and simplify the cleaning of .xlsx files. By utilizing the Pandas library, VClean efficiently processes data exported from a third-party application, transforming raw data into a usable format. This tool is intended to significantly improve our team's workflow, making essential data preparation tasks accessible even to users with limited technical expertise.

**V1 |**  You can now effortlessly generate three distinct output files. This includes a meticulously cleaned version of your .xlsx data, a .txt file specifically formatted for use with various generative AI platforms (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek), and another .txt file tailored for the Iramuteq application. Our primary goal with this update is to eliminate the time-consuming and training-intensive manual formatting process, providing an efficient, automated solution.

**V2 |**  Implement bi-weekly report with tag orientation. As well, it padronises the output names for better organisation.
